### Hinge Remonal

##### Attack

Next to the door there is a pin that you can remove

##### Mitigation

Security Hinges & Jamp Pin Screws

### Door Latch Attacks

##### Attack

You have some tool or sometimes just a screw driver and you can
push the door's latches (The one that you open or close the door) with it.
Like the thing we tried to do with the card in the party

##### Mitigation

The problem here is that the latches are not installed properly
The way to go are something called Dead Latches. Dead latches have
an extra pin that locks the door. The bad thing tho that many companies
do is that they don't have proper door fitment. So the dead latches
don't work properly

### Crash Bars

##### Attack

A lot of times there are wheather strips between doors (Like the supermarket)
and that's really bad cause you can you a tool to open the door from the
inside (DDT or double door tool or crashbar bypass tool, etc...)

### Thumb Turn Flipper

##### Attack

A lot of times you can find doors that have the locking mechanish in the
bottom and they turn from the inside to unlock or else you need a key
(We have it here in Greece). There is a tool that can flip this thump things
and open the door

### Request-to-Exit

##### Attack

There are electronic doors that need a badge to enter but not to exit
so if you happen to smoke or have a dust spray you can trigger the
top sensor and open the door

#### Mitigation

GE. Dual technology radar. It does infrared but also microwave radar. So
it has to see some temp change and also something like a human approaching it

### Modern Door Lever Style Handles

##### Attack

Under/Top Door attacks. You have a tool, and you put it under the door
and pull the lever from the inside

##### Mitigation

Under Door Attack Prevention - Security Door Bottom
Try shrouds or mount lever down or put clips

### Lockpicking

##### Padlock Shims

Padlock Shims are a tool that you can use for combination or locks
or regural locks. They look like birds? I don't know but
you do a little jiggle and boom you are in.

##### Lever Bypass

You can sometimes just put a long metal tool inside the padlock
move a metal thingy at the top and open the lock.

##### Warded "Picks"/ "Bypass Keys"

There is a tool that opens this type of lock and it was used
by houdini. It is the one with the cross-type end.

##### Actuator Bypass - American or Abus Tools

Found in 700, 1200
You take the tool (a metal rod with a twist in the end), and you
go deep and just turn.

##### Comp Picks / Overlifting

The pin champers are too long so you can use a tool called
comp pick and push all the pins up.

##### Sesame Locks

Found in Master 175

##### Decoding combo locks

There is a notch on each cyrcle. What you can do is to put
a lot of power to the oposite ends of the compination cyrcles,
and see how they move

##### "Jiggler" or "Tryout" Keys

Something with a spring

### Doors

##### Door Latch Bypass / Loid Tools

## Stuff for the solutions

**Overt entry** is when the method of entry causes damage or destruction.
This could be damage or destruction to locks, doors, windows, walls or other objects.

**Covert entry** is usually undetectable to un-trained people.
However, during a forensic investigation by trained professionals,
the method of entry would be discovered.

**Surreptitious entry** is when the method of entry is undetectable to
both un-trained and trained people.
This method would most likely go unnoticed even during a forensic investigation.
